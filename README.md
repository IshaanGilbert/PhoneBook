# PhoneBook
This C program is designed to function as a simple phone book application. Users can add contacts, view them, and exit the application. Below is a breakdown of its functionalities:

Welcome Message and Menu Display:

Upon starting the program, users are greeted with a welcome message and a menu displaying available options.
Adding Contacts (Option 1):

Users can choose to add contacts by selecting option 1 from the menu.
They are prompted to enter the number of contacts they want to add.
For each contact, users input details such as name, age, phone number, date of birth, and address.
Viewing Entered Contacts (Option 2):

Users can select option 2 from the menu to view the contacts they have entered.
They specify the number of contacts they want to view.
The program then displays the details of each contact entered earlier.
Exiting the Phone Book (Option 3):

Users have the option to exit the phone book application by selecting option 3.
Before exiting, they are asked to confirm their choice.
If confirmed, a closing message is displayed; otherwise, they can continue using the application.
Error Handling:

If users input an invalid option at the beginning, the program notifies them with an "Invalid" message.
Usage Instructions:

Users interact with the program by entering numeric choices corresponding to the menu options.
They input contact details as prompted, ensuring accuracy.
To view contacts or exit the phone book, users follow the instructions provided in the menu.
Explanation:

This program provides a basic framework for managing contacts. However, it lacks certain features found in more advanced phone book applications, such as search functionality, editing or deleting contacts, and saving contacts for future use.
Users should keep in mind that this program is intended for educational purposes or as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive phone book application.
Note:

As this program uses simple data structures and lacks advanced error handling and input validation, it may not be suitable for handling large amounts of data or robust user interactions. It's recommended for learning purposes or as a prototype.
